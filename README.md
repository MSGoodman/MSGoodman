I'm the Head of Engineering at [Sagetap](https://www.sagetap.io/ "Sagetap"), an online platform/marketplace designed to fix the
dysfunctional software discovery and sales ecosystem. From personal experience, I have come to firmly believe that:

- The way sellers approach their engagements with tech buyers is broken
- The way tech buyers find and evaluate software is inefficient and painful
- The relationship between these buyers and sellers is in need of an overhaul
- Sagetap can and will solve all of these problems

Reach out if you're interested in any way!

### Other

- I am a strong proponent of free and open-source software, and try my best to contribute to projects I use whenever I
  see somewhere I can be useful.
- I'm always happy to meet new people in the product/engineering/tech/startup/leadership space. Please feel free to reach out for
  any reason - collaboration, networking, advice, casually chatting - as long as you aren't trying to sell me something!
- I enjoy reading, data hoarding and knowledge organization, history (particularly late antiquity and the early medieval
  period), video games, and amateurishly partaking in hobbies like guitar-playing, birding, and homebrewing.
